# Learning NestJS

Note: All projects in my Github starting with a prefix of `learn` are projects I've done to learn a new technology or master an existing one.

## Purpose of Learning

I've been contributing to Twenty CRM recently. The projects uses NestJS on the backend. I'm working on a feature that adds email verification. I've made good progress. When a user trying to verify their email clicks on the link sent to their email, they navigate to the frontend page that takes the token from the searchParams and checks its validity by sending a request to the backend.

I'm having an issue where this throws a missing authentication token error and I can't figure out why. I'm trying to dive deeper into NestJS here so I have an easier time debugging this issue.
